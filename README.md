Video calling apps are now essential for staying connected with loved ones and for businesses to boost productivity. To make video calls more engaging, adding popular video filters like those on Snapchat and TikTok can add creativity and a competitive edge by enhancing personal expression and attracting users.

That’s why we want to demonstrate how to add them to a [Stream Video](https://getstream.io/video/)-powered application using [SwiftUI on iOS](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/ios/) with the help of the amazing services that [DeepAR](https://www.deepar.ai/) offers.

## 🏃🏼 Run the app

The application is built in SwiftUI, so we must run one of the latest Xcode versions (tested on both Xcode 14 and 15).

In addition, we need two API keys:

1. DeepAR license key (used in `FiltersService`) - follow the steps described [here](https://docs.deepar.ai/deepar-sdk/how-it-works#1-signing-up)
2. Stream API key (used in `StreamDeepARApp`) - get it [here](https://dashboard.getstream.io)

That's it! Go and run the app and have fun with it! ❤️

## 🤩 Expand the app

Feel free to experiment and add functionality to the app. You can either expand the video functionality (see the docs [here](https://getstream.io/video/docs/ios/)) or create your own filters and effects using [DeepAR studio](https://www.deepar.ai/creator-studio).

## 🛥 What is Stream?
Stream allows developers to rapidly deploy scalable feeds, chat messaging, and video with an industry-leading 99.999% uptime SLA guarantee.

Stream provides UI components and state handling that make it easy to build video calling for your app. All calls run on Stream’s network of edge servers around the world, ensuring optimal latency and reliability.

## 👩‍💻 Free for Makers 👨‍💻
Stream is free for most side and hobby projects. To qualify, your project/company needs to have < 5 team members and < $10k in monthly revenue. Makers get $100 in monthly credit for video for free. For more details, check out the [Maker Account](https://getstream.io/maker-account).
